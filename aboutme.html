        <p>
            I took this photo at my local record store named "Tunes" in Hoboken, NJ! I've been able to participate
            in the annual RSD in April thanks to them, I love making a day trip out of it during the summer and fall!
            <br></br>
            I attended the Shakira concert this past May, it was so cool seeing her live!
            <br></br>
            I recently became a member of Latinas in Tech this past spring and I was able to attend a networking 
            event at TDBank's office in NYC. It was such a cool day and meeting other female computer
            scientists share their wisdom definetely motiated me to apply to more programs and opportunities!

        <li>I am a huge music fan, I like to call myself a multistan because

    <h3>Sarah's KWK Journey!</h3>
    <ul class ="kwk-journey">
        <li>Summer 2021: I became a scholar at my first Kode With Klossy coding camp 
            in the Web Dev track! Shout out to my first ever instructors, Kang & Shoshi! </li>
            <br></br>        
        <li>Summer 2022: I absolutely loved my KWK experience and wanted to gain some final CS skills
            before college and returned for the Data Science track. Shout out to my DS instructors, Maya
            & Danielle! </li>
            <br></br>
        <li>Summer 2023: Being a freshman out of college, I didn't have many insights about internships 
            and wanted to help KWK bring that magic to the next generation of scholars and future STEM individuals.
            I became a KWK Instructor Assistant and it was so rewarding, shout out to all my co-IAs! </li>
            <ul>As a result of this job, I helped mentor a KWK scholar during their school year
                with a research project! This helped me gain communication skills and showcase my 
                leadership skills with teens.
            </ul>
            <br></br>
        <li>Summer 2024: I had debated between giving the IA job another summer or take all my skillsets and
            become an intern. I chose to challenge myself and ended up becoming a KWK intern! I was able to work
            with the same people who helped me enjoy the KWK camps but this time assist them with the KWK camps
            and reach a full-circle moment! I also got to assist with one session of the KWK Summer Speaker Series! ðŸ¤©ðŸ¤© </li>
