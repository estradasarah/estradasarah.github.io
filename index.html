    <p>Welcome to my webpage, feel free to explore this page to learn about me, 
        my interests, and overall journey in academia with tech!</p>
    <p class="about-me">Hello! My name is Sarah and I am a student at the 
        New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT). My journey in the world of computer science began
        when I attended my first Kode With Klossy (KWK) coding camp in the summer of 2021. 
        
       <br></br> Without the insight that KWK provided, I would not have been able to discover my passion for coding. 
        Continue browsing to learn my timeline so far, my hobbies, and deepen your lore about the person that
        Sarah Stacy Estrada is today!
